    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This smoked pulled pork recipe is the correct way to smoke a pork shoulder
      with professional results — from the cider brine and sugar rub to the rave
      reviews you will receive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smoke is the key to breaking down the fat, which adds flavor and moisture
      to the meat.
    </p>
    <p>Place in a bun with your favorite BBQ sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Pork shoulder: Pork shoulder is perfect for pulled pork because it’s
        inexpensive, forgiving to work with, and tends to have a lot of marbling
        (which means it’ll result in tender meat). An 8-pound pork shoulder
        roast should make about 20 servings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Apple cider: A simple apple cider brine ensures irresistible flavor and
        tender, juicy pulled pork.
      </li>
      <li>Sugar: Use a blend of white and brown sugars for the rub.</li>
      <li>
        Seasonings: The sweet and savory rub is flavored with kosher salt,
        paprika, onion powder, ground black pepper, and garlic powder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hickory chips: You’ll need three cups of soaked hickory chips for your
        smoker.
      </li>
      <li>
        Onion: An onion gives the pork even more bold flavor as it smokes.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Brine the pork shoulder.</li>
      <li>
        Pour the brine into the water pan of the preheated smoker with wood
        chips.
      </li>
      <li>Add the onion and ¼ cup of the rub.</li>
      <li>Season the pork with the remaining rub.</li>
      <li>Smoke the pork until tender.</li>
      <li>Let cool before shredding.</li>
    </ol>
